# CodePath-TipCalculator

TipCalculator is an iOS app that allows building a simple tip calculator interface, I personally added some animations. I am an Android engineer, with some experience in Objective C but this was my first full fledged swift app. I almost got close to implementing Apple Pay, next time ;)
